In case of an irreconcilable conflict the Act last acted upon by the General Assembly is controlling to the extent of such conflict. The Act last acted upon is determined by reference to the final legislative action taken by either house of the General Assembly, whether such final action is passage on third reading in the second house, concurring in or receding from an amendment, adoption of a conference committee report, acceptance of the Governor's specific recommendations for change, or passage over the Governor's veto. However, for the purpose of determining the effective date of laws under Section 10 of Article IV of the Constitution of 1970 and "An Act in relation to the effective date of laws", approved July 2, 1971, a bill is "passed" at the time of its final legislative action before presentation to the Governor as provided in paragraph (a) of Section 9 of Article IV of the Constitution of 1970.
An irreconcilable conflict between 2 or more Acts which amend the same section of an Act exists only if the amendatory Acts make inconsistent changes in the section as it theretofore existed.
The rules of construction provided for in this section are applicable to Acts enacted by the same General Assembly throughout the 2 year period of its existence.

Sec. 8. Omnibus Bond Acts.

(b) The General Assembly recognizes that the proliferation of governmental entities has resulted in the enactment of hundreds of statutory provisions relating to the borrowing and other powers of governmental entities. The General Assembly addresses and has addressed problems common to all such governmental entities so that they have equal access to the municipal bond market. It has been, and will continue to be, the intention of the General Assembly to enact legislation applicable to governmental entities in an omnibus fashion, as has been done in the provisions of the Omnibus Bond Acts.
(c) It is and always has been the intention of the General Assembly that the Omnibus Bond Acts are and always have been supplementary grants of power, cumulative in nature and in addition to any power or authority granted in any other laws of the State. The Omnibus Bond Acts are supplementary grants of power when applied in connection with any similar grant of power or limitation contained in any other law of the State, whether or not the other law is enacted or amended after an Omnibus Bond Act or appears to be more restrictive than an Omnibus Bond Act, unless the General Assembly expressly declares in such other law that a specifically named Omnibus Bond Act does not apply.
(d) All instruments providing for the payment of money executed by or on behalf of any governmental entity organized by or under the laws of this State, including without limitation the State, to carry out a public governmental or proprietary function, acting through its corporate authorities, or which any governmental entity has assumed or agreed to pay, which were:
(1) issued or authorized to be issued by proceedings
adopted by such corporate authorities before June 6, 1989 (the effective date of Public Act 86-4);
(2) issued or authorized to be issued in accordance
with the procedures set forth in or pursuant to any authorization contained in any of the Omnibus Bond Acts; and
(3) issued or authorized to be issued for any purpose
authorized by the laws of this State, are valid and legally binding obligations of the governmental entity issuing such instruments, payable in accordance with their terms.
